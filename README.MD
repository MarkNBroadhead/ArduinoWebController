# Web-based Arduino Pin Controller
## Description
This project creates a basic web server to provide instructions to the Arduino pins. It is meant to be used in a future Arduino robot project.

## Installation
Install the project by uploading the file using the Arduino application.

## Usage
Change the IP address at the beginning of the file to be the IP address you want for the Arduino. Access the webiste via a web browser. To change pins referenced by the buttons, change the constants PIN_1 - PIN_4.
